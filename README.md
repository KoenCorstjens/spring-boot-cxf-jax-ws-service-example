# spring-boot-cxf-service-example
Example for cxf web services with JAX-WS on spring boot 



**Remarks:**
cxf-spring-boot-starter-jaxws is not working with spring-boot 1.5.1, it wil be fixed in 
cxf-spring-boot-starter-jaxws version 3.2.0 and 3.1.11 see: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CXF-7198.
For this reason I use the older spring boot older version 1.4.4.
